    h2 Describe your programming background in a few sentences.
    p Iâ€™ve been self-studying web development with HTML, CSS, and JS for the past four years. I focused primarily on front-end design, and secondarily on learning the fundamentals of SPA development with popular JS frameworks. In recent months, however, my primary focus has shifted to really trying to learn and understand end-to-end JS and functional programming.
