### Device Testing an EPUB
There are many cloud services for testing websites in different browsers on different devices. As far as I know, there's no way to test an EPUB with any of these services, as you would need to launch the EPUB in an e-book reader app, not a browser window. There's nothing like Puppateer or Selenium for e-book reader apps. So, beyond building and then manually loading and testing, our options are very limited.
